## Overview
FlameEye-X is an ESP32-based smart safety system that **predicts and prevents kitchen fire hazards**.  
It fuses gas concentration, temperature rise, and flame detection to estimate risk and **autonomously act before ignition escalates**.

---

## Key Features
- Predictive risk estimation (probability-based, not fixed thresholds)
- Gas + temperature + flame multi-sensor fusion
- Autonomous mitigation: gas valve control, ventilation, alarms
- Real-time Wi-Fi alerts via **Blynk IoT**
- Adaptive baseline learning to reduce false alarms
- Typical end-to-end response time **< 10 seconds**

---

## System Working 
1. Sensors continuously sample the environment  
2. Data is normalized and evaluated using a risk probability model  
3. System states:
   - **Safe:** monitoring only  
   - **Pre-emptive:** ventilation and partial control  
   - **Emergency:** gas shutoff, alarm, mobile alert  

---

## Hardware Used
- ESP32 Dev Module  
- MQ-2 Gas Sensor  
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor  
- IR Flame Sensor  
- Servo Motor (Gas Valve Control)  
- Relay + Exhaust Fan  
- Buzzer, LEDs, LCD  

(Exact pin mapping is available in the documentation.)

## Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Firmware Setup
Use **PlatformIO (recommended)** or **Arduino IDE** with ESP32 support and required libraries.

---

### 2️⃣ Blynk & Wi-Fi Configuration (Required)
This project uses **Blynk IoT** for alerts and monitoring.

You must:
1. Create your **own Blynk template** in the Blynk Console  
2. Generate:
   - Template ID  
   - Template Name  
   - Auth Token  

Replace the clearly marked placeholders in the code:

```cpp
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID   "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID"
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME "YOUR_TEMPLATE_NAME"
#define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN    "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"

char ssid[] = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";
char pass[] = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

```

Safety Notice ⚠️:

This project is a prototype intended strictly for academic, research, and demonstration purposes.It is **NOT certified** for real kitchen or commercial deployment
Do NOT rely on this system for **life-critical safety**, Real-world use requires:

**1)Certified gas shutoff valves**

**2)Industrial-grade sensors**

**3)Electrical and fire-safety compliance**

**The user is fully responsible for safe deployment and usage.**
